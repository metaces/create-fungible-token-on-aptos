## 🧠 What is a Fungible Token?

A **Fungible Token (FT)** is a type of digital asset that is interchangeable with other tokens of the same type. Each unit of a fungible token has the same value and can be exchanged or traded with another unit without any difference.

### 🔍 Characteristics:
- **Interchangeable**: Each token is identical in value and function.
- **Divisible**: Can be divided into smaller units.
- **Uniform**: Each token has the same properties and value.

### 💡 Examples:
- Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, or Aptos Coin.
- Utility tokens used in games or platforms.
